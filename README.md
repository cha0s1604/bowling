# bowling
Currently grabs scoresheet data from links in bowling_score_links.txt and creates a list of bowlers.  
* Each list of bowlers can contain a list of seasons bowled. Currently only 1 season is explicitly created.  
* Each season has multiple series of bowling  
* Each series can have multiple games of bowling  

Statistics such as strike percentage, single pin make percentage, spare percentage, and open percentage are calculated for each series and also for the season for each bowler.
